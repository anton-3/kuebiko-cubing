general:
- TESTS
- fix how data is shown for a full cstimer export that has multiple sessions with the same name
- refactor so that the frontend doesn't stall on a single request till the processing is done
  - mainly so cloudflare doesn't nuke all reqs that take longer than a minute
- optimize loading times in general

WCA ID stuff:
- optimize wca id extraction
  - I think it unzips the whole massive 200mb zip every single time someone puts in a wca id which makes it super slow
- properly handle invalid wca id input

---- old todo below
