general:
- TESTS
  - integration: a script that hits the submit endpoint with different data, simulates polling, tests response. maybe snapshot testing?
  - unit: call process_data with LOTS of different files/options/etc. cover every supported timer data format
- optimize loading times
  - for processing solve data upload, maybe migrate to polars?
  - look for other options as well
- fix how data is shown for a full cstimer export that has multiple sessions with the same name
- for WCA ID queries, seems like replacing zipfile->polars stuff with an sqlite db would make things literally 1000x faster
- make the sessions list scrollable instead of scrolling down the whole page

low prio:
- plotly.js version is like four years old
- ensure mobile styling is not shit
- bug with multiple sessions showing at once? like one below the other

---- old todo below
TODO puz-cat tabs prevent second row on mobile. collapse? images? also collapse long main nav?
