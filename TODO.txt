general:
- refactor so that the frontend doesn't stall on a single request till the processing is done
  - mainly so cloudflare doesn't nuke all reqs that take longer than a minute (and I'd rather keep cloudflare proxying so)
- TESTS
- optimize loading times
  - for processing files, maybe migrate to polars?
  - look for other options as well
- fix how data is shown for a full cstimer export that has multiple sessions with the same name
