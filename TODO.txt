general:
- refactor so that the frontend doesn't stall on a single request till the processing is done
  - mainly so cloudflare doesn't nuke all reqs that take longer than a minute
- TESTS
- optimize loading times in general
  - on WCA IDs, it unzips all the data in the history of WCA and then filters for relevant lines by doing a linear search through literally everything. we can probably frontload the initial .tsv processing and store the data in memory in some way so that we get constant or log n lookups
  - for txt's, still gotta look into it
- properly handle invalid wca id input
- fix how data is shown for a full cstimer export that has multiple sessions with the same name
