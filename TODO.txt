- optimize wca id extraction
  - I think it unzips the whole massive 200mb zip every single time someone puts in a wca id which makes it super slow
- properly handle invalid wca id input
- probably a lot of other stuff worth doing too I've barely looked at the codebase

---- old todo below
TODO puz-cat tabs prevent second row on mobile. collapse? images? also collapse long main nav?
