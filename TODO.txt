general:
- refactor so that the frontend doesn't stall on a single request till the processing is done
  - mainly so cloudflare doesn't nuke all reqs that take longer than a minute (and I'd rather keep cloudflare proxying so)
- TESTS
- optimize loading times
  - for processing solve data upload, maybe migrate to polars?
  - look for other options as well
- fix how data is shown for a full cstimer export that has multiple sessions with the same name
- for WCA ID queries, seems like replacing zipfile->polars stuff with an sqlite db would make things literally 1000x faster

low prio:
- plotly.js version is like four years old
- ensure mobile styling is not shit

---- old todo below
TODO puz-cat tabs prevent second row on mobile. collapse? images? also collapse long main nav?
